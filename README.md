# Glioma_Network_BDM_Signatures
The codes and results associated with our paper "Decoding Neurodevelopmental Dynamics in Pediatric High-Grade Gliomas: Divergences in Transcriptomic Network Complexity from Healthy Neural Stem Cell Signatures". 

Our complex systems approaches reveal causal drivers of developmental plasticity and state-transitions in pediatric High-Grade Gliomas (pHGGs).
This repository contains code for deriving BDM-based plasticity signatures from bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data to identify causal biomarkers regulating glioma cell fate decisions. Our study reveals neurodevelopmental attractor biases, bioelectric/neurotransmitter circuitry, and ECM–immune coupling as interlinked drivers of malignant plasticity, proposing actionable targets for predictive, preventive, and precision oncology.

The repository includes:

DEG BDM Analysis.ipynb — pipeline for bulk RNA-seq DEG analysis and BDM computation.

Glioma Single Cell BDM.ipynb — single-cell transcriptomic network perturbation analysis for BDM signature derivation.

Attached results as .zip folders containing processed datasets, BDM outputs, and ranked biomarker tables.
